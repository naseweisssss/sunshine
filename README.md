### Solar Data Display
This Historical Data Tracker includes an interactive page to adjust parameters to view the data. Thanks to NASA Power API, we are able to request the latest data for different parameters, so there is no need to update our database frequently
### Output Calculator
This novel Solar power output calculator helps our homeowners to gauge and get amazed by how much energy solar power can save. Equipped with a simple algorithm, our calculator can compute the output of the solar panel on a particular period. By just inputting your location, we can calculate your electricity bills saved with your local rate!
### Solar Panel Recommendation
Connected with local e-commerce platforms, users can compare the prices from different merchants and even get recommendations from our ends.
